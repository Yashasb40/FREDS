The project is a free social media platform which serves as a community group also where the
users can interact with their friends and alsobe able to look at the vast majority of the
announcements/events even if they are not followers of the person.
Freds creates a safe and secure environment for users to work with along with being able to
handle the queries that the user makes with an inbuilt window which can take the user query and
fetch the desired results.
In terms of future additions, Iâ€™d be implementing a mechanism for the admins to remove a user
who has been blocked by lots of other users indicating that person might have been toxic.
